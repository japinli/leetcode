# 461. Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance][] between two integers is the number of positions at
which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

__Note:__

* `0 <= x, y < 2^31`.

__Example:__

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
