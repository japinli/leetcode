# 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three
integers in `nums` such that the `sum` is closest to `target`. Return the
sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have
exactly one solution.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

__Constraints:__

* `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
* `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
* `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
