# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its _maximum depth_.

A binary tree's __maximum depth__ is the number of nodes along the longest
path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

__Constraints:__

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`.
