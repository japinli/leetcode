# 938. Range Sum of BST

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all
nodes with value between `L` and `R` (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
```

__Note:__

1. The number of nodes in the tree is at most `10000`.
2. The final answer is guaranteed to be less than `2^31`.
