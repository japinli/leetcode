# 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)``.

Compute and return the square root of `x`, where `x` is guaranteed to be a
non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only
the integer part of the result is returned.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.			 
```
