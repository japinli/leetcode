 * first_bad_version.c
 *   You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a
 *   new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product
 *   fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on
 *   the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also
 *   bad.
 *
 *   Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find
 *   out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be
 *   bad.
 *
 *   You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return
 *   whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad
 *   version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
